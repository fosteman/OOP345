# STL Algorithms
In this workshop, you use the Standard Template Library’s algorithms to evaluate sample data.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to
- copy data from a file into a sequential container
- accumulate data values using the STL’s numeric library
- specify an operation on each value in a data set using a lambda expression
- sort the data values in a data set using the STL’s algorithm

## Introduction to Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis uses standard measures to make predictions based on a small sample of the actual data:
- sample mean — the average of all values in the sample
- sample standard deviation — the spread of the numbers away from their mean
- sample median — the middle number in the sorted set of the values (that is, the value separating the lower and upper halves of the data in a sorted set)

### Sample Mean
The formula for _sample mean_ is:
